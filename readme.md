# Classification of Digits from Audio Samples using Machine Learning
## Project for COMP 6321: Machine Learning

This a collaborative project where different machine learning algorithms are implemented to classify the digits to its respective classes
System requirements:

- Python 3.8

To start the development, create a conda/python virtual environment and run the following command inside it:

<code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>

Too see the accuracy of different models, change the main comments to what you are looking for.

To run the tests, run the following command:

<code>python -m pytest tests/</code>
